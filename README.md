The first Exam for the Backend Part of the Bootcamp Course was two weeks after the start of the Backend-Part, or 10 Weeks into the course.
This was done with PHP, CSS/Bootstrap and HTML.
The task was to create a site for a Library which had Books, CDs and DVDs in their inventory.
For the project we had to create a database with MySQL.
The information for the items in the DB had to be: title, image, ISBN (or EAN) code, short-description, type (book, CD, DVD), author's first name, author's last name, publisher's name, publisher's address, pubishing date
The image could be uploaded via FileUpload, or given only as a internet-link or via a name with all images already saved in a folder.
The following things were graded:
The media was to be fetched from the database created and displayed to the user on the page.
Make it userfriendly and nice to look at with Boostrap and/or CSS.
Input into the DB: A user should be able to put data for a new item into the db using the frontend form.
Each item should display as a card with a Details Button, which would lead to an individual page for the specific media.
The details page should show all the information about the specific media-item.
The publisher's name should be clickable and should lead to a site showing all the media published by this specific publisher.
Allow users to search for Media by Author or Title using a simple search form.
For this project I got 40/40 points.
To get the project running, don't forget to import the database into your MySQL and change the db_connect according to your setup.
